# RDP Customer Interfaces

In this phase, we are primarily focused on the interfaces for the customer/guest facing aspects of the app. We know that Cucumber runs slower on some devices and that you may not have a complete understanding of how the pages should roughly look. To that end, we are providing a series of screenshots of key interfaces (**obviously not all; these are not comprehensive**) and hope this is helpful in guiding you in your front-end development. You do NOT have to match these exactly (your style may differ, that's fine) and some of the data will not match the Cucumber tests exactly; this is meant as helpful guidance and not exactly as pages should look.
