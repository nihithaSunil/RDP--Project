Roi du Pain is a full-stack Ruby on Rails application built over four phases for CMUâ€™s 67-272 course. It enables customers to place bakery orders and allows admins to manage baking and shipping. The app includes user authentication, role-based authorization with CanCan, responsive design using MaterializeCSS, and exposes RESTful JSON APIs. Development followed strict MVC architecture with test-driven development using SimpleCov and Cucumber, achieving 100% model test coverage. Business logic is handled through service objects, and all views and controllers were written manually without scaffolding. The result is a secure, responsive, and production-ready web application.
